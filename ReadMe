Hi! This is a game i coded using Java called Happy Chicken!
During Year 1 of my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at City St Georges University of London, I coded this game as my final project for my Programming in Java module. 
This game uses CityEngine. I designed this game from scratch, from the pictures to coding of the game. There is also a video in the file, that explains how to play the game
and how the game works! I hope you like my game, and have fun playing!
